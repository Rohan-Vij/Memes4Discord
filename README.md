# Memes4Discord
Ever come up with a great idea for a meme on when talking with your friends on Discord, but by the time you can get around to making it, the conversation has moved on?

Me neither, but I still made this.

### Required modules
The modules required are:
1. pillow - `pip install pillow` 
2. discord - `pip install discord`

### How to use it:
As of now, the only meme template available is the Bernie Sanders "I am once again asking for..." meme template. As of now it only works with my profile picture, but I'll update it soon!
Syntax: `.sokkafy example`
Try it out yourself!

### To do
- [ ] Add more meme templates
- [ ] Actually utilize the benefits of OOPs by adding subclasses for each template
- [ ] Use polymorphism with the write() and reset() methods
- [ ] Robust error handling when the user inputs strings   

### Warning
Self-botting is against Discord's TOS, and can get your account banned. Use this at your own risk.
